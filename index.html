        <h2>Welcome to Waypoint</h2>
        <p>We have a set of simple (and not so simple) code snippets to help you get started with your web development
            journey. These code snippets are all written in HTML, CSS and may have a little bit of JavaScript.</p>
        <p>They are based on the questions and problems I encountered when I first started with web development.</p>
        <p>All the code is open source (it's not like there's enough code to justify copyright) and available on <a
                href="">GitHub</a>.
        </p>
